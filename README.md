# data-analysis
This study presents a research approach using data mining technique for predicting the performance of data analysis using python model such as linear regression, multiple linear regression from Linear model, polynomial regression ,support vector machine from the scikit-learn module.
We tried to fit linear model as well as scikit-learn module in the best possible way so that to predict the output with least percentage error. To minimize the percentage error we kept eye on it using least square method for linear model and confusion matrix for scikit-learn module.
Using these above techniques we will be able to predict the difference in performance for the data analysis. Also we will compare the difference in the performance due to those two different model and justify the cause for the difference.
